# 🔐 OpenSSL RSA Encryption Project

## 📄 Description

This project demonstrates how to use **OpenSSL** to perform basic RSA cryptographic operations: generating key pairs, encrypting messages with a public key, and decrypting them with the corresponding private key. It serves as an introductory exercise in understanding public-key cryptography via the command line.

## 🧰 Languages and Utilities Used

- **OpenSSL** – for key generation, encryption, and decryption  
- **Terminal / Command Line Interface** – for running commands  
- **Text Editor** – for creating and editing text files (plaintext messages)

## 💻 Environments Used

- macOS (via Homebrew)  
- Linux / Windows (use appropriate OpenSSL distribution or package manager)

## 🚶‍♂️ Project Walk-through

### 1. 🔧 Installing OpenSSL

Install OpenSSL via your system’s package manager. Example for macOS:

```bash
brew install openssl
